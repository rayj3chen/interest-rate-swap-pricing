# Interest Rate Swap Pricing with QuantLib

This project demonstrates how to price an **interest rate swap** using the **QuantLib** library in Python. It includes the calculation of the Net Present Value (NPV) of the swap, analysis of the fixed and floating legs, and visualization of the yield curve.

## Overview

An **interest rate swap** is a financial derivative in which two parties agree to exchange interest payments based on a specified notional amount. This project uses the **QuantLib** library to:
- Define the terms of the swap.
- Create a yield curve for discounting cash flows.
- Calculate the NPV of the swap.
- Visualize the yield curve.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- **QuantLib**: For financial calculations.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing the yield curve (optional).
